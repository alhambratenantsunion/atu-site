Founded in 2020, the Alhambra Tenants Union (“ATU”) is a tenant-led and based membership organization that fights for a human right to housing. As wages have declined and housing is commoditized and speculated on by landlords and real-estate capital, working class tenants—which include all who do not have control over their housing—face displacement, eviction, rising rents, encampment sweeps, and landlord and police harassment.

ATU is committed to collectively building the power of Alhambra tenants, buildings, and neighborhoods to resist the destruction of our homes. Together, we work towards a world that prioritizes the housing needs of the many over the profits of the few.
